# Code-Alpha_Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project aims to harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and interpret the sentiment of tweets. By processing vast amounts of Twitter data, this project seeks to determine the general sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in tweets about specific topics, events, or products.
